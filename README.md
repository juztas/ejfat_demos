# ejfat_demos
This is a repository of EJFAT demos.  They will largely require no external dependancies on DAQ sources or other hardware, with some exceptions.  Each demo will be contained in its own subdirectory.

# Prerequisites
#. [Install E2SAR](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/E2SAR)
#. Obtain an EJFAT URI from the administrator of your target FPGA load balancer
#. Test connectivity using E2SAR's supplied validation checklist
